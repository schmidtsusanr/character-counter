<h2>Character Counter</h2>
<section>
  My friend <a href:"http://fontlovestudio.com/about/">Elana</a> is a phenomonal letterpress printer. She asked me if I knew of any online tools that would count the number of each character in a string of text, so she would know whether she had enough characters in the desired font to print it. I decided to create this tool as a solution to that problem. Let me know if you'd like for me to add anything else to this tool!
